Vizzini is a suite of tests that runs against the Diego BBS API.

## What's In Here

- Under the top-level directory are tests that exercise the core of Diego and
  the HTTP routing tier through a variety of use-cases. Although they are
  primarily used to accept stories related to the details of Task and LRP
  behavior, they are a valuable integration suite for Diego as a whole. Also,
  they are fast and can safely be run in parallel.
